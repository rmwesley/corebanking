Exposed Endpoints
-----------------
Check the project's `Swagger` documentation for details and information on the endpoints.
Just head to `/swagger-ui/index.html` after running the Spring-Boot application.
`Swagger` doesn't only provide documentation, you can try out the endpoints as well, just like as you would do with Postman!

Maven Commands
--------------

- `mvn clean` cleans `target/` directory
- `mvn install` builds the project
- `mvn test` Runs unit tests

	Pay attention, test coverage reports are generated by JaCoCo, and kept in  `target/site/jacoco/`. You can view the test results nicely by accessing `target/site/jacoco/index.html`.

- `mvn compile` Formats code according to Google Java Format standards
- `mvn spring-boot:run` runs the Spring Boot application
